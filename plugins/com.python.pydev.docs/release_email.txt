PyDev 11.0.2 Released

PyDev 11.0.2 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

Continuing with the updates to Python 3.12, the new release integrates
the latest version of typeshed (so, **from typing import override** is
now properly recognized).

Also, it's now possible to specify vmargs in the python interpreter
(and not just in the launch configuration).

For Python 3.11 onwards, **-Xfrozen_modules=off** is now
set in the vm arguments by default.
